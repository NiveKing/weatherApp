# weatherApp
3rd project
My First time using API and React's useEffect.

Copied a project on youtube but made adjustments becuase it was outdated (latidude and longitude needed and not the location). 
The code on youtube only used 1 api, I used to 2 because I need to get the lats and lons first before i cant fetch a data (Or mayve i used the wrong API).
I fixed it by learning how to use useEffect.
